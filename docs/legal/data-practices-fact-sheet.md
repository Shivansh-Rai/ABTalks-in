## Personal data by store

### Neon (primary)

| Model | Notable fields |
|-------|----------------|
| User / Account | email, name, image, OAuth tokens |
| StudentProfile | fullName, college/org, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, resume URL, skills |
| PhoneVerification | E.164 phone + verified flag |

| RecruiterReview | assessment + shareToken; published reports |
| ProgramMember | professional profile, phone (admin-only), GitHub repo |
| ProgramInterview | transcript JSON, scores, summary |

## Cookies (first-party)

| Cookie | Purpose | Max-age | Consent |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Auth.js session | Login | session/JWT policy | Strictly necessary |
| `abtalks_consent` | Stores cookie choice + policy version (`<choice>.<version>`) | 180 days, **not** httpOnly (client must read it) | Strictly necessary |
| `abtalks_ref` | Referral `?ref=` | 7 days, httpOnly | Set only on `all` / `limited` |
| `abtalks_src` | Share attribution `?s=` | 30 days, httpOnly, first-touch | Set only on `all` / `limited` |

Since plan 060, `middleware.ts` reads `abtalks_consent` and sets no attribution cookies until the user chooses; on `essential` it actively expires both. Consent choice is **not** persisted to the database — the cookie is the record.

No Google Analytics / PostHog / ad pixels in app code today.

## Third-party scripts loaded in the browser

| Script | Origin | When |
|--------|--------|------|
| MSG91 OTP widget | `verify.msg91.com/otp-provider.js` | Injected at runtime by `src/components/shared/phone-verify-field.tsx` only when the user uses phone verification |
| YouTube embed (program) | `youtube-nocookie.com` + `i.ytimg.com` | Click-to-load facade (`src/components/shared/lite-youtube.tsx`). Preview thumbnail from `i.ytimg.com` is fetched only when consent is `all` |
| YouTube embed (challenge day page) | `youtube-nocookie.com` | `src/components/challenge/day-page.tsx` mounts the iframe on page load, **not** gated on consent — deliberate product decision, disclosed in the Privacy and Cookie policies |

## Processors

Vercel (hosting/cron), Neon (DB), Google (OAuth), Supabase, MSG91 (OTP SMS), Resend & Brevo (transactional email), Anthropic (grading/mentor), OpenAI (voice interview Realtime), GitHub API (commit/repo checks).
