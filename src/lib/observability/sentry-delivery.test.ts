/**
 * T-259 Part 10 — proof that an error actually reaches Sentry, with an event
 * id, correlated to a request, and carrying no secrets.
 *   npm run test:observability:sentry
 *
 * The plan's evidence step was "hit a hidden /api/dev/boom route and look at
 * the Sentry dashboard". This does the same thing without leaving an
 * unauthenticated error endpoint in a production deployment: it stands up a
 * throwaway HTTP server, points a DSN at it, and reads the envelope the real
 * `@sentry/nextjs` SDK puts on the wire.
 *
 * That is a stronger check than the dashboard screenshot, because the bytes
 * are inspectable: the assertions below are that the payload contains the
 * event id and the correlation tags, and does NOT contain the password, token,
 * cookie or contact details that were deliberately planted in the error, the
 * scope and the breadcrumbs.
 *
 * It runs in a child process. `Sentry.init` is global and one-way, so
 * initialising it inside the main test runner would leak into everything else.
