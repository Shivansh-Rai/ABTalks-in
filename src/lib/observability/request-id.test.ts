/**
 * T-259 Test C — request correlation.
 *   npm run test:observability:request-id
 *
 * This drives the **real** `middleware.ts` with real `NextRequest`s rather than
 * a copy of its logic, because the thing that can break is the merge: this
 * middleware already does auth redirects, referral cookies and consent, and a
 * request id that only appears on one of those branches is worse than none.
 *
 * It then checks that the id survives into the logger, which is the other half
 * of correlation — an id in a response header that never reaches a log line
 * correlates nothing.
